	Classic dynamic lights

	Quake II and Quake III lit the world from the events themselves: every
	muzzle flash, every glowing projectile and every explosion allocated a
	short-lived point light that decayed away over a tenth of a second or so.
	Quake 4 instead relies on authored BSE light segments, and most of the
	shipped effects carry none -- player projectiles other than the
	single-player rocket and grenade are unlit, and no explosion in the game
	flashes the room at all.

	This is that classic layer, rebuilt on top of the render lights the game
	already owns.  It is purely a client presentation feature: nothing here is
	simulated, saved or networked, and every light is derived from an event
	that already reaches the client on its own.

	Colors are taken from the shipped Quake 4 assets (weapon def "flashColor"
	values, and the tints of the light segments Raven did author in
	effects/weapons and effects/monsters) so the classic lights read as part of
	the same effect rather than a wash of arbitrary color over it.
